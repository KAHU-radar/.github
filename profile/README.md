Enhancing maritime safety through interconnected vessel radar imagery
Maritime safety is vital to preserving the integrity of our oceans and ensuring secure navigation for all.

If you're a sailor, you can now contribute to this mission and we are excited that you decided to do so.

Our initiative aims to "fill the gaps" in AIS data by crowdsourcing radar data from vessels, just like yours. By sharing radar tracks of vessels you encounter at sea, you help us create a more comprehensive and reliable picture of maritime activity that is available for everyone to see.
Install OpenCPN and the Radar and Crowdsource plugins.
Sign up here to generate an API key for the Crowdsource plugin.
Start collecting and sharing vessel tracks.

As a thank you for your contribution, youâ€™ll gain access to our database, providing valuable insights to enhance your navigation and situational awareness at sea. We are also in the process of designing a more attractive incentive system to make it worthwhile for you to contribute continuously.
