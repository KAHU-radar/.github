# Overview
Development focus has switched from the OpenCPN plugin, which is currently in working beta stage, to Signal K. For signal K, there are three different components: radarhub, mayara and radar_receiver.
The SignalK radarhub plugin performs the same function as the opencpn one: receiving radar RATTM messages and uploading tracks to our cloud solution.
Mayara and radar_receiver are two complemntary methods to get access to raw radar imagery and produce radar tragets. Mayara is a logn term solution, while radar_receiver is a technically inferior solution that can be made to work much more quickly.

# Current status of Radarhub

Radarhub for Signal K is in alpha. It might need a bugfix for the same distance unit bug that radarhub for OpenCPN had. It needs testing.

# Current status of Mayara

* We have contributed the split of mayara into a rust library and the webserver.
* We have begung wrapping the rust library as a nodejs library (Signal K is written in nodejs)
* Mayara currently lacks ARPA tracking

# Current status of radar_receiver

* OpenCPN radar_pi has been successfully ported to run outside of OpenCPN, as a nodejs library
* A testing nodejs application is able to receive both radar spokes and arpa targets
* A SignalK plugin wrapping this library, producing ARPA targets for Radarhub is half done

# Comparison of Mayara and radar_receiver

* Mayara is written by the same author as radar_pi for OpenCPN and is set to replace radar_pi
* Mayara is written in rust, radar_pi in c++
* radar_pi is quite badly organized, mixing GUI code and radar reception code
  * A large part of writing radar_receiver was removing / disabling / replacing this GUI code
* Radar support
  * radar_pi supports many more radar types than Mayara
  * Mayara currently supports a Furuno radar, something radar_pi does not
